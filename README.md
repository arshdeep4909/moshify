buttons

-so we divided buttons based on - upon their skin & based upon their width property

- one was takingthe size of container and other just to fit the content - also one was outline button which was just the part
  of the card block

Input group

- creating the input group along with the button
  -crating both component in the same div to give the
  illusion of a single element
- finished creating the whole block and giving it all the styles

cards

-creating a basic structure of a card
-just defining a header and different skins for the header
-defining a body and just a basic layout, the padding, text color etc

plan

- created the complete card component including the list
- used the card component build befoer and then added badges and list
  components which were previously created
- Also create a new class and then used pseudo selector to add the
  popular badge on the plan
- a better approach then adding the popular badge mannualy
